# Executive Summary

## Backwards compatibility
Ember implements upgrades and changes in such a way that you don't have to worry about a costly app re-write. Typically, changes are either backwards-compatible, or have a script that runs the modification on the existing code. 

## Standards
Ember uses strong conventions, which translates into *anyone* on *any* team in *any* location can jump right in and start being productive! It also makes it easy to get help from the supportive Ember community. 

## Top Talent- at other companies!
These standards also allow any size company to benefit from talented developers who have created open-source solutions as part of their day jobs at Netflix, LinkedIn, Playstation and Addepar, just to name a few. 

## No Ember? No problem!
Because Ember is the original javascript framework, it doesn't have to be the most popular one. Developers who already know Javascript or other Javascript frameworks like Angular or React will be able to learn Ember- and probably appreciate the sense of consistency they will experience as a result!
